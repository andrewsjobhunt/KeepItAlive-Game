First attempt at coding a game for Ludum Dare #46. Didn't meet deadline so I will use this as learning opportunity and finish the game.

No frameworks.
No sound.
Sprite animation to be included.

1. Make a game
2. Clown has to live
3. We control the clown
4. Clown moves in a canvas area
5. Make this game like Yena's poop game
6. Keep track of score
7. Left/Right movement
8. x and y coordinates of two object types - player clown and deadly objects

Game is up on https://andrewlalala119278.web.app - hosted with Firebase.
Not complete (movement still to be fixed) but for the most part, I want to move on to the next project.
This game did not use object oriented programming until the end for the score tracker.
